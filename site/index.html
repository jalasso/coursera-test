            <span>I took this really cool course
            </span></div>
        <span>on Coursera.org. I think it's
            my favorite course I've EVER taken!
            Here is the URL for it:
            </span>
        <a href="...">HTML, CSS and JS for Web Developers</a>
        <div>
            Does anyone know how I can give this course 6 out of 5 stars?
        </div>

            Thank you, -Yaakov.... I mean a random student! Definitely not Yaakov.
